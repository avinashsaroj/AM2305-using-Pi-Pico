### Measuring temperature and humidity using Pi Pico
AM2305 capacitive humidity sensing digital temperature and humidity module is one that contains the
compound has been calibrated digital signal output of the temperature and humidity sensors. Application of a
dedicated digital modules collection technology and the temperature and humidity sensing technology, to ensure
that the product has high reliability and excellent long-term stability. The sensor includes a capacitive sensor wet
components and a high-precision temperature measurement devices, and connected with a high-performance
8-bit microcontroller. The product has excellent quality, fast response, strong anti-jamming capability, and
high cost. Each sensor is extremely accurate humidity calibration chamber calibration.

Following readings were obtained, for the change in the environment conditions, a fan , a wet cloth was used:
